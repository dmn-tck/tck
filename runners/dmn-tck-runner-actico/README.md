# ACTICO DMN TCK test runner

The *ACTICO DMN TCK test runner* is a Java command line application that is able to automatically execute the DMN TCK suite of tests.
It uses the *ACTICO DMN runtime* and is based on the DMN TCK test runner. 
The *ACTICO DMN runtime* is compliant with level 3 of the DMN 1.1 specification. It is able to execute any DMN model without any preprocessing.

The test runner can execute multiple tests that are stored in test subfolders. 
Each subfolder name must comply with the DMN TCK naming convention: `<4 digit number>-<testname>`
Each subfolder must contain a test XML file describing the test cases and the tested DMN model file. The filename of the test XML File must comply with the DMN TCK naming 
convention: `<4-digit number>-<testname>-test-<testnumber>.xml`
The test XML file must comply with the XML schema testCases.xsd. 
The DMN model file must comply with the XML schema of the DMN 1.1 specification.

The test runner is also able to execute a single test folder, containing the test XML file and the DMN model file.

The test runner creates a result file in CSV format used by the DMN TCK.
